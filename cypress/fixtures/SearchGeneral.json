Ko doesn’t take advantage, sending her second wide right of the green, but Noh gives herself another look at birdie, this time from 12 feet.

Then it’s the only member of the final three-ball to find the fairway, and of course Lee6 ends up the furthest away, albeit only by a couple of feet. That’s golf for you.

There’s a fair chance that an on-song Jeongeun Lee6 will beat that today, but let’s not get ahead of ourselves, there’s plenty of golf to be played. Anyway, Chun sends her second at 1 to six feet, and guides in a gently oscillating birdie putt to move to -10.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60fd39f88f0814e7a3171b29\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-07-25T10:20:04.164Z\">11.20am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Also going well: Lizette Salas. </strong>The 32-year-old Californian pushed Nelly Korda all the way at the PGA last month; she’s also got a second-place finish at the British Open on her CV, one putt away from taking Hinako Shibuno to a play-off at Woburn in 2019.

To illustrate, may we present as evidence Leona Maguire: the 26-year-old from County Cavan in Ireland has fair flown out of the traps today: birdies at 1, 2, 3, 7 and now 8 have whisked her right up the leaderboard to -8. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60fd33428f08bb57f5f7f1cd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-07-25T09:50:32.858Z\">10.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>It’s a misty morning on the shores of Lake Geneva. </strong>There were storms last night, while some thunder rolled in a couple of hours ago.

David Hockney once described his visit to the museum as <a href=\"https://dennissevershouse.co.uk/about/dennis-severs/\">“one of the world’s five top experiences”</a>.</p> <p>Severs came to London from the US in the 1960s. After dropping out of a law career he bought a horse and carriage and offered tours of London. He was essentially a showman and, incredibly, was allowed to keep his carriage in the Royal Mews.</p> <p>In 1979 he bought a run-down Georgian house in Folgate Street, Spitalfields, and embarked on a mission to create the history of London inside it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11bc0c46500f2516b9f5452b3c64bbdeaa8e8e3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11bc0c46500f2516b9f5452b3c64bbdeaa8e8e3a/0_165_6207_3723/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The dining room at Dennis Severs’ House\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The dining room at Dennis Severs’ House.

Entering a room feels like stepping in to a painting that has exploded into three dimensions.</p> <p>Severs’ friend, the art historian and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07c5zj1\">TV presenter Dan Cruickshank</a>, said: “Dennis was always up front about this. It was never meant to be an accurate historical creation of a specific moment, it was an evocation of a world, it was essentially a theatre set.”</p> <p>He stuffed rooms with period objects or he made them himself. What looks like an expensive late-17th-century swag over a fireplace was, in fact, made from varnished walnuts strung together. The magnificent four-poster bed he slept in was pallets and polystyrene.</p> <p>There were sounds and also smells, particularly memorable in the Victorian poverty and squalor room. “They were disgusting,” recalled Cruickshank. “Whatever it was, it was real.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c49575485dc3e0a71bc1d2079acc40b1c994a56f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c49575485dc3e0a71bc1d2079acc40b1c994a56f/0_212_6098_3660/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Victorian room at Dennis Severs’ House\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Victorian room at Dennis Severs’ House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Severs lived in the house and would conduct the tours. Tourists were sometimes terrified, said Cruickshank. “You were paying money but he didn’t want you to feel you had control of him or the house. He would say ‘feel don’t think, look don’t speak … open yourself to the experience you are going to have’. He wasn’t talking about facts and figures, he was talking about the essence of life.”</p> <p>At times he would throw people out, tossing their entrance fees after them. “It had a wonderful effect on the people left behind: they thought, ‘Christ, that could happen to me.’”</p> <p>Severs died in 2000 aged 51 and the house has continued to be run as a museum.</p> <p>During lockdown staff were astonished to discover about 200 cassette tapes stuffed in cupboards that feature Severs’ tours as well as his ideas and thoughts on people and sounds he liked.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jul/04/hidden-london-tram-station-opens-to-public-for-first-time-in-70-years-kingsway\">Hidden London tram station opens to public for first time in 70 years</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was odd to hear them, said Cruickshank. “The barbed comments, the accusations, the instructions, the keeping his audience in its place so they would listen to him … that is all in the tapes.”</p> <p>The tapes have been distilled down to create a new tour for visitors when it reopens on 29 July.

I’m Caroline Davies and here are some key developments to kick off today. </p> <p>In the <strong>UK</strong>, it is being reported that only fully-vaccinated football fans may be able to attend Premier League matches and other events with more than 20,000 spectators from October under government plans. PA reports that talks are in an early phase with the Premier League to discuss whether supporters who have not been double-jabbed could be barred from entry, the news agency understands.</p> <p>It adds that prime minister Boris Johnson risks provoking further criticism from backbench Conservatives as ministers seek to extend the future use of vaccine passports from nightclubs to sporting stadiums. The use of vaccine passports could also be extended to lower divisions and other sports in England as ministers seek to reduce the surge of Covid-19 cases as other restrictions are ended.</p> <p>While no final decisions have been made, it is currently being discussed whether vaccine passports could be introduced for seated events with a capacity of 20,000 people and over, the PA reports. </p> <p>Meanwhile summer holiday plans for nearly six million Britons could be ruined if <strong>Spain</strong> and <strong>Greece </strong>follow <strong>France </strong>onto the “amber plus” list requiring isolation on return, according to an analysis. Labour said an estimated 5,857,558 people face the prospect of last-minute quarantine requirements to protect against the spread of coronavirus after booking trips over the “summer of chaos”.</p> <p>The government introduced an exemption for the requirement to isolate at home for 10 days for fully-vaccinated holidaymakers returning from countries on the amber list. But ministers removed the exemption for France amid concerns over the Beta variant, creating what critics call an “amber plus” designation on the traffic light system for foreign travel.<br></p> <p>There has been speculation that Greece and Spain could face the same measures as France, though the UK government has not confirmed this.</p> <p>As always, you can get in touch on caroline.davies@theguardian.com</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-07-25T07:21:59.176Z\">at 8.21am BST</time></p>  </div>",

There was much talk of Junichi Inamoto making millions for Arsenal when the Japanese midfielder arrived in 2001 but whereas his signing was big news in east Asian football circles, his departure after making no league appearances was barely noticed.</p> <p>These days most in Europe surely recognise that imports from the east are usually pretty good (like players of all nationalities who make big moves overseas, some fail to settle while others thrive) yet the notion that they also have in their proverbial lockers equally impressive abilities to sell shirts and turn a hefty percentage of those four billion or so Asians into fans of their new club seems to persist.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jun/01/ange-postecoglou-has-credentials-to-deliver-at-celtic-if-he-is-given-time\">Ange Postecoglou has credentials to deliver at Celtic if he is given time | Jonathan Howcroft</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An article in the Scottish media last weekend after Celtic recruited one of the biggest talents in Japanese football began: “New Celtic signing Kyogo Furuhashi can help the club make a fortune in Asia, football experts say. Analysts have told how the Japanese star, 26, will give the Hoops access to the massive ‘untapped’ Asian market.” </p> <p>Such refrains may have faded but can still be heard whenever players from Japan and South Korea head to Europe –it would be the case with China too if they exported more talent – and this commercial baggage is not something that arrivals from elsewhere in the world are burdened with.</p> <p>In the case of Furuhashi at Celtic, there is undoubted interest in Japan. The attacker leaves Vissel Kobe and the J.League as the top scorer and a genuine talent. He is also the first signing made by Ange Postecoglou, who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jun/10/celtic-confirm-appointment-of-ange-postecoglou-as-new-manager\">arrived in Glasgow from Yokohama F.Marinos</a>, the club he led to the J.League title in 2019. In the space of a few weeks, two of the biggest figures in Japanese football have left for Celtic and the club’s progress will be followed in Kobe and Yokohama especially.</p> <p>But the Japanese are not suddenly going to turn into Celtic fans – why should they? This is not, after all, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/04/shunsuke-nakamura-celtic-gordon-strachan-yokohama-j-league\">Shunsuke Nakamura’s time</a>. That playmaker’s move to Parkhead in 2005 was huge news because he was one of the first Asians to go to a big European club. Celtic moved quickly to set up a Japanese-language website, impressive in pre-social media days, and reporters quickly left Tokyo to set up camp in Glasgow to follow Nakamura’s every silky move.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f44bfd24e847e5a1103914961b2caf9bc75f163\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f44bfd24e847e5a1103914961b2caf9bc75f163/0_57_2519_1512/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wataru Endo, here holding off Borussia Dortmund’s Jude Bellingham, is not making millions for Stuttgart in shirt sales.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wataru Endo, here holding off Borussia Dortmund’s Jude Bellingham, is not making millions for Stuttgart in shirt sales.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Weller/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now however, there are dozens of Japanese players in Europe, many playing at a higher level than Furuhashi. With the J.League in action during rescheduled World Cup qualifiers in May, the national team coach Hajime Moriyasu simply selected a squad that was 100% Europe-based. There is no reason why more attention will initially be paid to Furuhashi than Wataru Endo of Stuttgart, Ritsu Doan at PSV Eindhoven or Maya Yoshida of Sampdoria, none of whom are making millions for their clubs in shirt sales. Elsewhere in Asia, an incredibly diverse continent, there is little reason for fans in China or India to notice, let alone care, that another Japanese player has gone to Europe, especially to a league that few have any interest in.</p> <p>It is possible to turn general interest in Japan, South Korea or elsewhere into something more tangible but this is usually connected to on-field success and still needs hard work. Players must play often, play well and get talked about a lot by teammates, opponents and media (such stories do very well back home). Obviously, the bigger the league and the club, the easier and more lucrative it can be. Park Chu-young’s move to Arsenal in 2011 seemed to tick most of the boxes: a big star joining a big club in a big league but initial excitement in South Korea had long turned to annoyance by the time he left in 2014 after playing only seven minutes in the league.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8af74e6d087431a6ec38c36965eea76f77841e38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8af74e6d087431a6ec38c36965eea76f77841e38/0_191_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Park Ji-Sung (centre) did help the Manchester United brand and bank balance during seven years at the club.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Park Ji-Sung (centre) did help the Manchester United brand and bank balance during seven years at the club.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Park Ji-sung’s seven years at Manchester United were different and undoubtedly helped the United brand and bank balance. ‘Three-Lung Park’ (that a skilful and technically gifted player became largely feted for his work rate and humility is connected to another east Asian stereotype that lingers) was a reasonably important player in a very successful team known around the world and that tapped into national pride, as did Kagawa’s first spell at Borussia Dortmund.</p> <p>The exploits of Park, Kagawa and, of course, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jul/23/tottenham-give-son-new-four-year-deal-and-maintain-kane-is-not-for-sale\">Son Heung-min</a>, mean that there is more respect these days for the best that Asia has to offer. Furushashi could well add to that reputation, though it will have limited effect because although Celtic are a huge club, Scotland’s league is not seen in the same light. If he is a success in Glasgow then perhaps there will be a few compatriots rushing out to buy the famous shirt but it is much likelier that they will be debating which English Premier League club he should join.</p>",

So many times they had their opponents pinned back in desperate defence and Germany’s goalkeeper Julia Sonntag was inspired. Afterwards GB’s captain, Hollie Pearne-Webb, knew it was one that got away. “It was a really dominant performance. On balance of play, the points should have been ours,” she said. But GB were also wasteful, and Pearne-Webb admitted as much. “We didn’t make sure it was three points.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jul/25/chelsie-giles-wins-britains-first-medal-of-tokyo-olympics-with-bronze-in-judo\">Chelsie Giles wins Britain’s first medal of Tokyo Olympics with bronze in judo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then there was also the issue of the video referral system, and in particular the award of Germany’s penalty stroke that felt decisive.

Amid a goalmouth scramble to clear the ball, GB were penalised and the on-field umpire awarded Germany a penalty stroke.</p> <p>Then, the farce began. First, a long delay as the video umpire considered the TV replays while the players sweltered. Eventually, the on-field umpire was told the attacking player touched the ball with a foot and GB should be awarded a free-hit. No, said the on-field umpire; please look at it again. Another long delay followed, before the TV official agreed the on-field umpire had been right all along. Huse converted, and the pendulum had swung.</p> <p>In the third quarter GB kept the pressure on, but Germany grew in confidence and the winner came when they cleared a goalmouth scramble in their own circle and sent play upfield where Stapenhorst fired home from Pia Maertens’ pass.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for our Tokyo 2020 briefing with all the news, views and previews for the Olympic and Paralympic Games.\">  <iframe id=\"tokyo-2020-daily-briefing\" name=\"tokyo-2020-daily-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/tokyo-2020-daily-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--tokyo-2020-daily-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up for our Tokyo 2020 briefing with all the news, views and previews for the Olympic and Paralympic Games.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>There were more overly-long video referrals and more penalty corners for Britain as the match wore on but Germany were resolute in their defence. A final penalty corner chance with two minutes left was pushed frustratingly wide, not even testing the Germans. It was head-in-hands time for GB’s head coach Mark Hager, and that rather summed things up.</p>",
